# Create Repository

A repository is a place to store version controlled code, enabling one or more developers to collaborate on the code, keeping a history of all changes. This is known as source control. You'll be adding a project which will automatically create a repository, this will enable you to add code and make changes to that code in further steps, simulating how an individual or team works with source control.
